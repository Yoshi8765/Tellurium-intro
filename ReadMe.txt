Proposed order
1. Igem modelling intro with example code [intro.py (do models 1-3, don't do libstructural)]

2. Learning Tellurium exercises (Learning Tellurium.pdf)

3. Replicate Central Dogma [intro.py (replicate central dogma problem with a parameter sweep of a_m and a_p)

4a. Structural analysis using MCA (libstructural in intro.py)

4b. Phase Analysis [hw6.py]

5. Create Chemotaxis models [??]
